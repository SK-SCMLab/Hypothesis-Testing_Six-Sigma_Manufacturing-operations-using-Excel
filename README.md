# ‚è≥ Hypothesis-Testing_Six-Sigma_Manufacturing-operations-using-Excel
This repository contains case studies from real-world manufacturing environments, demonstrating how hypothesis testing can be applied to assess process changes, quality improvements, and machine performance using Excel. Each study includes the full hypothesis setup, test selection, and interpretation

## üíΩ Hypothesis testing
Hypothesis testing is used to prove or disprove a theory or claim by comparing two or more samples or comparing a signel sample to a defined value
- Six Sigma methodologies produce significant improvements in average performance
- The product quality is independent of supplier
- The average cycle time for processing similar products is the same between two different facilities

*Benefits*
- Handle uncertainty in data
- Minimize subjectivity
- Question assumptions
- Manage decision error risk

*Steps involved in Hypothesis testing*
1. Determine what to compare and assume that there is no difference
2. Decide how much risk of being wrong is acceptable
3. Use data to calculate a test statistic
4. Compare the test statistic to a critical test statistic
5. Make a decision by comparing p-value to accepted risk value

| *Null Hypothesis* | *Alternative Hypothesis* |
|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 1. Represented as H‚ÇÄ | 1. Represented as H‚Çê |
| 2. Statement of no change or difference | 2. Statement of change or difference |
| 3. Cannot be proved, only rejected | 3. Challenges the null hypothesis |

- Null states that there is no difference in means (H‚ÇÄ: Œº‚Çê = Œº‚ÇÜ)
- Alternative is stating there is a difference in means
